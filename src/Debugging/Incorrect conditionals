Incorrect Conditionals
Incorrect conditionals are one of the most common types of logical errors, which can be seen while using conditional statements like if-else and loops.

Example
The code below is supposed to do the following:

If an integer is even, then output True.
If an integer is odd, then output False.
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();

        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            System.out.println("false");
        } else {
            System.out.println("true");
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
However, the code above is incorrect:

Based on the requirement, if n % 2 == 1, i.e. for odd numbers - we should output false.

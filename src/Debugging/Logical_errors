Logical Error or Wrong Answer (WA)
A logical error is an error in a program that occurs when the code compiles and runs without producing any error messages, but it does not produce the expected or desired output.
Instead, it performs a different computation or provides incorrect results due to a flaw in the algorithm or logic of the program.
Typically, debugging logical errors requires more effort compared to other types of errors.

They can be categorized into different types:

Incorrect Conditions
Incorrect Index
Incorrect variable usage

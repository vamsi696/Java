Mismatched Parenthesis
There should be one closing bracket for each opening bracket and the closing bracket should also be of the same type, like (),{},[]

If we try to use different opening and closing brackets, it can give you a syntax error.

int a  = ( 5+7 } ;     // incorrect due to the usage of mismatched parenthesis

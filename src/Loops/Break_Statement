Break Statement
You have already seen the break statement used in an earlier module of this learning path.
It was used to jump out of a switch statement.
The break statement can also be used to jump out of a loop.

for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
  if (i == 4) {
    break;
  }
  System.out.println(i);
}

While Loop
Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true.
They are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.

The while loop, loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true:

while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}
Example:

int a = 1;
while (a < 5) {
    System.out.println(a);
    a++;
}
Flow of the loop:

When the loop starts, value of a is
1
1. The condition a < 5 is true, so the loop body executes.
It prints
1
1, then increments a to
2
2.
The loop checks the condition again. Since a (now
2
2) is still less than
5
5, it executes again, printing
2
2 and incrementing a to
3
3.
This process repeats. The loop prints
3
3, then
4
4.
When a becomes
5
5, the condition a < 5 is no longer true. The loop stops, and control moves to any code that follows the loop.
So, the output of this loop will be:

1
2
3
4
It prints each number from
1
1 to
4
4, then exits as a reaches
5
5.

For Loop
When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop:

for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
    // code block to be executed
}
Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block. Its called Initialization statement.
Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block. Its called condition statement.
Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed. Its called update statement.
Example

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    System.out.println(i);
}
Explanation of the code:

int i = 0; - This declares an integer variable i and initializes it to 0. It's the starting point of the loop.
i < 5; - This is the loop's condition. The loop will continue to execute as long as this condition is true. In this case, as long as i is less than 5.
i++ - This is the increment operation. After each iteration of the loop, i is increased by 1.
Loop Execution Flow:

In the first iteration, i is 0, so 0 is printed.
i is incremented to 1, and since 1 is less than 5, the loop continues. 1 is printed.
This process repeats until i becomes 4 and 4 is printed.
When i is incremented to 5, the condition i < 5 becomes false, so the loop stops.
Output

0
1
2
3
4

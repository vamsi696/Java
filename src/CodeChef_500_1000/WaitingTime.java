//Waiting Time
//Chef is eagerly waiting for a piece of information. His secret agent told him that this information would be revealed to him after
//        K
//K weeks.
//
//X
//X days have already passed and Chef is getting restless now. Find the number of remaining days Chef has to wait for, to get the information.
//
//It is guaranteed that the information has not been revealed to the Chef yet.
//
//Input Format
//The first line of input will contain an integer
//        T
//T — the number of test cases. The description of
//        T
//T test cases follows.
//The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
//K
//K and
//X
//X, as described in the problem statement.
//Output Format
//For each test case, output the number of remaining days that Chef will have to wait for.

//Explanation:
//Test case
//        1
//        1: The information will be revealed to the Chef after
//1
//        1 week, which is equivalent to
//7
//        7 days. Chef has already waited for
//        5
//        5 days, so he needs to wait for
//        2
//        2 more days in order to get the information.
//
//Test case
//        2
//        2: The information will be revealed to the Chef after
//1
//        1 week, which is equivalent to
//7
//        7 days. Chef has already waited for
//        6
//        6 days, so he needs to wait for
//        1
//        1 more day in order to get the information.
//
//Test case
//        3
//        3: The information will be revealed to the Chef after
//1
//        1 week, which is equivalent to
//7
//        7 days. Chef has already waited for
//        1
//        1 day, so he needs to wait for
//        6
//        6 more days in order to get the information.
//
//Test case
//        4
//        4: The information will be revealed to the Chef after
//1
//        1 week, which is equivalent to
//7
//        7 days. Chef has already waited for
//        2
//        2 days, so he needs to wait for
//        5
//        5 more days in order to get the information.

//Endless Appetizers
//Life is a like a box of of mozzarella sticks. You never know what you're gonna get, but you can predict with 100 percent accuracy that it will be a mozzarella stick.
//
//Chef's colleague issued a challenge to Chef: "If you eat more than
//X
//X mozzarella sticks, I'll give you
//        30
//        30 rupees for each extra one you eat".
//For example, if
//X
//=
//        5
//X=5 and Chef eats
//8
//        8 sticks, he would receive
//90
//        90 rupees because he ate
//3
//        3 extra sticks.
//
//You know that the restaurant serves
//Y
//Y mozzarella sticks per plate.
//You also know that Chef received
//R
//R rupees from his colleague as a result of the challenge.
//
//        What's the maximum number of plates of mozzarella sticks that Chef could have ordered?
//
//Note:
//
//Chef won't order a new plate till he finishes eating all the sticks from the previous one.
//However, it's possible that Chef didn't finish all the sticks from the final plate he ordered.
//See the explained examples below for more clarification.
//Input Format
//The first line of input will contain a single integer
//T
//T, denoting the number of test cases.
//Each test case consists of one line of input, containing three space-separated integers
//X
//,
//Y
//,
//X,Y, and
//        R
//R — the lower limit on the number of sticks, the number of sticks on a single plate, and the money received by Chef.
//Output Format
//For each test case, output on a new line the answer: the maximum number of plates Chef could have ordered.

//        7 5 30
//        16 5 0

//        2

//        94
//Explanation:
//Test case
//        1
//        1: Chef received
//30
//        30 rupees; meaning he ate
//1
//        1 extra stick.
//Since
//        X
//        =
//        7
//X=7, this means he must've eaten exactly
//        8
//        8 sticks.
//        At
//5
//        5 sticks per plate, Chef would need
//2
//        2 plates to eat
//8
//        8 sticks (and two sticks from the second plate will remain uneaten).
//
//Test case
//        2
//        2: Chef received
//0
//        0 rupees. Since
//        X
//        =
//        16
//X=16, this means he ate
//≤
//        16
//        ≤16 sticks.
//The maximum he could've eaten is exactly
//        16
//        16; and this would require
//4
//        4 plates since each plate has
//5
//        5 sticks.
//
//        Test case
//        3
//        3: Chef received
//120
//        120 rupees, meaning he ate
//4
//        4 extra sticks.
//This makes for a total of
//15
//        +
//        4
//        =
//        19
//        15+4=19 sticks, and at
//9
//        9 sticks per plate he would need
//3
//        3 plates.

//For a certain cricket match, Chef has decided upon his team of
//11
//        11 players. However, he hasn't yet decided who should be the captain and who should be the vice-captain.
//
//He's narrowed his decision down to
//N
//N players out of the
//11
//        11, from which he'll choose one to be the captain and one to be the vice captain.
//How many different choices does he have?
//
//Input Format
//The first line of input will contain a single integer
//T
//T, denoting the number of test cases.
//The first and the only line of each testcase contains a single integer
//        N
//N, the number of players Chef is considering.
//        Output Format
//For each test case, output on a new line the number of possible choices of captain and vice-captain.
//

//Explanation:
//Test case
//        1
//        1: With
//        N
//        =
//        2
//N=2, there are only two possibilities: one of the players must be selected as the captain, and the other will become the vice-captain.
//
//        Test case

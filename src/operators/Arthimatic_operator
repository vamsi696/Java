Arithmetic Operations
We can also perform basic mathematical operations with numbers.

int a = 6;
int b = 3;
Use + for addition:

  System.out.println(a + b); // prints 9
Use - for subtraction:

  System.out.println(a - b); // prints 3
Use * for multiplication:

  System.out.println(a * b); // prints 18
Use / (forward slash) for division:

  System.out.println(a / b); // prints 2
Use % (percent symbol, called modulo operator) for the division remainder:

  System.out.println(a % b); // prints 0 as 6 is evenly divisible by 3
Use ++ for increasing the value of a variable by 1:

  a++;
  System.out.println(a); // prints 7
Use -- for decreasing the value of a variable by 1:

  b--;
  System.out.println(b); // prints 2

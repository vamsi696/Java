Logical Operators
Logical operators help you combine multiple conditions to check if they are true or false. They are often used to make decisions based on multiple criteria.

Basic Logical Operations
Here are the basic logical operators and their usage:

&&   (Logical AND: returns true only if both conditions are true)
a > 5 && a < 10  // returns true only if a is greater than 5 but less than 10
||  (Logical OR: returns true if at least one condition is true)
a > 10 || a < 5  // returns true if a is greater than 10 or less than 5
!   (Logical NOT: reverses the result of the condition)
!(a > 5 && a < 10) // returns true in the opposite cases of the first condition above

Assignment Operators
In Java programming, assignment operators help you set or change the value of a variable. They're like little shortcuts that combine assignment with other operations.

Basic Assignment
Here's a simple example:

int length = 15;
In this example, the = operator sets the value of length to 15.

Compound Assignment Operators
There are also compound assignment operators that perform an operation and then assign the result back to the variable. Let's look at a few:

x -= 5        (Subtracts 5 from x and assigns the result back to x)
x *= 3        (Multiplies x by 3 and assigns the result back to x)
x /= 3        (Divides x by 3 and assigns the result back to x)
x %= 3        (Finds the remainder when x is divided by 3 and assigns the result back to x)

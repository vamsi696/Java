Conditional Operator
The conditional operator, often referred to as the "ternary operator", is a special operator in Java that allows you to perform a conditional operation in a concise way. It's the only ternary operator in Java and takes three operands: a condition, a value to return if the condition is true, and a value to return if the condition is false.

Syntax:
condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false;
Explanation:
condition: This is the expression to be evaluated. If it is true, the operator returns value_if_true; otherwise, it returns value_if_false.
value_if_true: This is the value returned if the condition evaluates to true.
value_if_false: This is the value returned if the condition evaluates to false.
Example:
int a = 10, b = 5;
int max = (a > b) ? a : b;
In this example:

(a > b) is the condition.
a is value_if_true.
b is value_if_false.
If a is greater than b, max will be assigned the value of a; otherwise, it will be assigned the value of b.

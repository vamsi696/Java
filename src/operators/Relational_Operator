Relational Operators
Relational operators help you compare two values or variables. They give you a result of either true or false based on the comparison.

Basic Comparison
Let's start with a simple example:

int height1 = 12;
int height2 = 14;
System.out.println(height1 < height2); // Outputs 1 (true) because 12 is less than 14
In this example, the < operator compares height1 and height2. Since height1 is less than height2, it returns true, represented by true.

Other Relational Operators
Here are some more examples of relational operators:

a > b          (Checks if a is greater than b)
a == b        (Checks if a is equal to b)
a != b        (Checks if a is not equal to b)
a >= b        (Checks if a is greater than or equal to b)
a <= b        (Checks if a is less than or equal to b)

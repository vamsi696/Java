Return values
Methods in Java can serve two primary purposes when it comes to providing information to the caller: they can either return a value or print an output.

Returning Values from Methods:
When a method returns a value, it provides a piece of data back to the caller.
This data can be used for further processing, assignment to variables, or any other purpose within the program. The return statement is used to send a value back to the caller.

Check the sample below:

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int result = calculateSquare(5);
        System.out.println("Square of 5: " + result);
    }

    // User-defined method to calculate the square of a number
    public static int calculateSquare(int num)
    {
        int squareResult = num * num;
        return squareResult;
    }
}

// Output:
// Square of 5: 25
Printing Output from Functions
A Method can also directly print output to the console using print statements.
However, this doesn't provide any data back to the caller in a way that can be used elsewhere in the program.
The primary purpose here is to display information, not to provide data for further processing.

Check the example below which gives the same output as the code above:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printSquare(5);
    }

    // User-defined method to print the square of a number
    public static void printSquare(int num) {
        int squareResult = num * num;
        System.out.println("Square of " + num + " is: " + squareResult);
    }
}

// Output:
// Square of 5 is: 25

//Calculator
//Complete the given program to create a simple calculator that performs addition and subtraction.
//
//Declare 2 integer variables a and b
//Initialize the variables a and b with two user inputs.
//Declare an integer variable sum - and assign the value of addition of a and b to it.
//Declare another integer variable diff - and assign the value of subtraction of a and b to it.
//Output sum and diff to the console on separate lines with the same message as given in sample output.

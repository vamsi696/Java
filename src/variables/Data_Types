Data Types
Lets look at some common data types found in programming problems for beginners

Integer

Integers are whole numbers that can be negative, zero or positive. Examples - 15, 0, -5
Double

A double will have a decimal place. Examples:- 4.5, -2.778
Note that 4.0, -2.0 are also doubles
String

Strings are a group of characters. Examples:- abcde, CodeChef, START69
Note that strings can also contain numerical characters. Examples:- a1b2c3d4, 532
Array

Arrays are used to store multiple variables (of the same datatype). Examples of arrays
Array containing 6 integers - {1 , 5, 7, 10, 15, 2}
Array containing 4 strings - {"abcd", "d", "ccc", "c123"}
Array containing a combination of string and integers cannot be created. You can only store elements of the same datatype in an array.
Note that the strings in the array are enclosed inside inverted comma's like "abcd" - we will come to this at a later stage

Concatenation
The '+' sign can be used between strings to add them together to make a new String.
This is called concatenation.
For eg -

String x = "Good";
String y = "Work";
System.out.println(x + y);
// output will be: GoodWork
Note: You can add spaces between words by using an empty " " with a space inside or by providing a space in the end of a word.
For eg -

String x = "Good";
String y = "Work";
System.out.println(x + " " + y);
// output will be: Good Work

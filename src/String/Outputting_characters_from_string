Outputting Characters from a String
We use the concept of indexing to find the position of a character in a string, which means every character in a string corresponds to a number/position called the index number.

index

Note - Indexing always starts from 0 when going left to right.

To access the value of a specific character in a string, we refer to the index number, and use the charAt() method.

String myString = "Chaf";
System.out.println(myString.charAt(2));

Output:
a

String myString = "Chaf";
System.out.println(myString.charAt(0));

Output:
C

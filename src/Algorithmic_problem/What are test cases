Coding problem - 3
Chef is taking his baby steps into the world of programming.

The very first program he's tasked to write is as follows:
"Given two integers
A
A and
B
B, print
A
+
B
A+B."

Unfortunately, Chef makes a typo: his program outputs
A
×
B
A×B instead of
A
+
B
A+B.

Given the values of
A
A and
B
B, can you help Chef find the absolute difference between the correct answer and the value his program prints?

Debug the code in the IDE to solve the problem.
Input Format
The only line of input will contain two space-separated integers,
A
A and
B
B.

Output Format
Print a single integer: the difference between the correct answer and Chef's output.

Sample 1:
Input
Output
4 7
17
Explanation:
The correct answer is
4
+
7
=
11
4+7=11, but Chef's program prints
4
×
7
=
28
4×7=28.
The difference between them is
∣
28
−
11
∣
=
17
∣28−11∣=17.

Sample 2:
Input
Output
1 6
1
Explanation:
The correct answer is
1
+
6
=
7
1+6=7, but Chef's program prints
1

6
=
6
1×6=6.
The difference between these values is

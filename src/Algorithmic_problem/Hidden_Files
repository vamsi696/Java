What are hidden test files and test cases
So far we dealt with test files and test cases which were visible to you.

However, programming platforms typically have hidden or private test files and test cases. What are these?

Private test files check for the following:
Test your code for logic.
Test your code for corner cases / edge cases.
Test your code for handling scale -> does your program solve within time and space constraints?
What do these private test files do?
Your code is run on each test case within the private test file.
This generates your actual output.
This is judged against the expected output.
If the actual output and expected output match, then your code is correct.

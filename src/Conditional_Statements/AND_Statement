And Statement
Till now we used only one condition in our if or else if statements. But what if we want to use multiple conditions? Say we want to check if a person is female and older than 18 years of age, how can we do that in Java?

To achieve that, we have to learn about logical operators.

The && (pronounced "and") keyword is a logical operator that allows you to combine multiple conditions.
It returns true if all the conditions are true, and false if at least one condition is false.

Let's start with a simple example.
Suppose you have two variables: x and y. You want to check if both x and y are greater than 5. Here's how you would use the && operator to combine these conditions:

int x = 8;
int y = 10;

if (x > 5 && y > 5) {
    System.out.println("Both are greater than 5");
} else {
    System.out.println("At least one of them is less than 5");
}

// Output
// Both are greater than 5

Curly braces
Let's take a look at the code from last problem:

int age = 25;
int voting_age = 18;

if (age >= voting_age) {
    System.out.println("Old enough to vote!");
} else {
    System.out.println("Not old enough to vote.");
}
To things to note here:

The condition age >= voting_age is inside parentheses ( ).
The System.out.println() statements are inside curly brackets { }.
The parentheses are mandatory after if statement, and the condition comes inside them. We use curly brackets in Java to define scope. Because of the curly braces, Java knows that it has to execute the print statement if the condition becomes true

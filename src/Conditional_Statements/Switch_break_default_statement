Switch, Break and Default statement
We can use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.
We can use the break statement to end the execution of code at a specific point.

The Syntax is as follows:

switch(expression) {
  case x:
    // code
    break;
  case y:
    // code
    break;
  default:
    // code
}
The switch expression is evaluated once and the value of the expression is compared with the values of each case. If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
When Java reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block. This will stop the execution of more code and case testing inside the block.
The default keyword specifies some code to run if there is no case match.

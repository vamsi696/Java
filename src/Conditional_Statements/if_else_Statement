If & Else Statements
We use conditions in code for decision making and controlling the flow of a program.

if and else keywords can be used together to create conditions.

The syntax for this:

if (condition) {
    // code to run if the condition is true
} else {
    // code to run if the above condition is false
}
Condition can be any expression which you are trying to evaluate. A simple condition can be:

int a = 4;
int b = 5;
if (a == b) {
    System.out.println("a and b are equal");
} else {
    System.out.println("a and b are not equal");
}

// Output:
// a and b are not equal
a == b is used to check whether the values of variables a and b are equal. == is called a equal to operator.

Here's a table of common operators used in Java conditions:

Operator	Description	Example
==	Equal to	a == b
!=	Not equal to	a != b
>	Greater than	a > b
<	Less than	a < b
>=	Greater than or equal to	a >= b
<=	Less than or equal to	a <= b

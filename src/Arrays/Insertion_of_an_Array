Insertion in an array
Inserting elements into a 1D array involves adding a new element at a specific position within the array.

This often requires shifting the existing elements to make room for the new element.
Here's a step-by-step process for inserting elements into a 1D array:

Determine the Position: Decide where you want to insert the new element in the array.
You need to know the index (position) where you want to place the element.
Shift Elements: Starting from the last element, move each element one position to the right until you reach the desired position for the new element.
This creates space for the new element.
Insert the New Element: Once you have shifted the necessary elements, you can insert the new element into the empty position you created.
Update Array Size: If your array is dynamically allocated, make sure to update its size to reflect the new number of elements.

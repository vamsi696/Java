Creating Arrays
Arrays are used to store multiple items of the same type together.

An array is defined by specifying the type of its elements and the number of elements it will hold.

For example, you can declare an array numbers that can hold five integers as follows:

int[] numbers = new int[5];
You can also set the values at the time of declaration. For example:

int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
Here, each element in the array numbers gets the corresponding value.

Note: In Java, the new keyword is used to create new objects and dynamically allocate memory for them. When declaring an array, the new keyword is used to allocate memory for the array elements.

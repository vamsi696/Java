Index & printing specific elements of an Array
We can access an array element by referring to the index number inside square brackets [ ].
Similar to what we saw in string, array items are also indexed and we can access them by referring to their index number.

num[3] = {1, 100, 200};
//        0   1    2    - index numbers

System.out.println("%d", num[1]);

// Output:
// 100
Note - Same as string, indexing in array too always starts from
0
0, going left to right.
